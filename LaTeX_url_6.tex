\end{center}

{\large Time for urls ::: }

If you want to put url on document then do this :

\vspace{1cm}

This is my website  \url{https://zaynkhan100110.github.io}

This is my  \href{https://zaynkhan100110.github.io}{website}

\vspace{1cm}

So i give here 2 type of hyper links which can redirect to the

destination. So here is the recipe ::

1. I give a complete url for my webpage which can take to the link

Destination.

2. I give a link inside of text so if some click on text this will also

take to the destination place ( my webpage ).


Here's how to do ::

\vspace{0.5cm}

1. This is my website $\backslash$url\{https://zaynkhan100110.github.io\}

\vspace{0.5cm}

which link i put inside the \{\} that will redirect if you click.

\vspace{0.5cm}

2. This is my $\backslash$href\{https://zaynkhan100110.github.io\}\{website\}

\vspace{0.5cm}

so after $\backslash$href \{\} is contain our link for destination and

after link \{\} contain text what will be appear on our document

this one is similar to html href.

\vspace{0.5cm}

Remember if you want to put links which contain ( \_ ) underscore

or other symbol at that time you need more things to do you can

 see the documentations on overleaf or some other \TeX\ place.

\vspace{0.5cm}

Note ::

You will need hyperref and url package for this.
